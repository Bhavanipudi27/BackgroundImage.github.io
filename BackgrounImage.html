   <div>CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets” which is a technology
   to control how elements are presented in the Web page.The term 
   Cascading refers to the procedure that determines which style will
   apply to a certain section, if we have more than one style rule.
   The term Style refers to how you want a certain part of our page 
   to look. We can set colors, fonts, alignment, borders, backgrounds,
   spacing, margins, and much more.The term Sheets represents that 
   the “sheets” are like templates, or a set of rules, for determining 
   how the webpage will look.So, CSS (all together) is a styling language 
   that defines a set of rules to tell browsers how the webpage should 
   look.A style sheet is a document that contains style information 
   about one or more documents written in markup languages. It enables 
   us to control rendering of styles such as fonts, color, type face, 
   size and other aspects of document style.</div>
   
   <p>Most of the browsers cache external style sheets. So, once a style 
   sheet is cached, there is no delay in document presentation.The size 
   of a document using external style sheet is comparatively smaller and
   hence, download time is also smaller. This speeds up overall response time</p>
   <p> IDs and classes function the same way. They both can provide the same 
   styling functionality to an HTML element, however IDs are unique; 
   each element can only have one ID, and that ID can only be on the 
   page once. Classes are not unique; an element can have multiple 
   classes, and multiple elements can have the same class.<p>
   <div>IDs can be used to style elements that are different from anything 
   else on the page. Classes can be used to style multiple elements on a 
   single page that have things in common, like font size, color, or style.
   Style classes allow us to control which elements of a given type should 
   use a style rule. This method has two parts:In the style sheet, the 
   selector defines the class name, which is preceded by a period.In the 
   HTML, the tag includes the class attribute and specifies the value of 
   the class name.</div>
